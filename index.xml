XAMPP uses MariaDB which is almost similar to MySQL but here is the catch, almost. It came to my notice when I started to work with JSON.

My use case My wife wanted to enroll in an online course, but the deadline had passed. When she contacted the center, they informed her that they had recorded classes from the previous two days, and that she could join and catch up with the current batch if she so desired. However, they usually delete the recorded videos within 7 days. However, we decided to enroll in the course, but discovered that the watch hours of the recorded classes were too many to cover in a few days, and the files were protected, so there was no way to download and watch them later.</description></item><item><title>MySql Tips and Tricks</title><link>https://blog.markcite.com/blog/mysql/mysql-tips-and-tricks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:39:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.markcite.com/blog/mysql/mysql-tips-and-tricks/</guid><description>Repairing utf8 broken characters Sometimes during data table backup or migration, you may end up having broken utf8 characters. A easy way to solve the problem is following the below SQL Query: 1 2 UPDATE table_name SET column_name = CONVERT(BINARY CONVERT(column_name USING latin1) USING utf8); That&amp;rsquo;s it.

My wife joined the internship program in a Medical College Hospital yesterday. This morning she showed me a PDF file of a hand note for the treatment protocols in Obstetric Department. She said to me that do you have any better version of that?
Well, during my internship program, I wrote some treatment protocols in a word file. So I thought why not make an HTML app from these word files and pack them into a WebView of a Flutter project to make an Android app for my wife.</description></item></channel></rss>
