My use case My wife wanted to enroll in an online course, but the deadline had passed.

However, they usually delete the recorded videos within 7 days. However, we decided to enroll in the course, but discovered that the watch hours of the recorded classes were too many to cover in a few days, and the files were protected, so there was no way to download and watch them later.</description></item><item><title>MySql Tips and Tricks</title><link>https://blog.markcite.com/blog/mysql/mysql-tips-and-tricks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:39:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.markcite.com/blog/mysql/mysql-tips-and-tricks/</guid><description>Repairing utf8 broken characters Sometimes during data table backup or migration, you may end up having broken utf8 characters.
