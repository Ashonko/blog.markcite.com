### A new start
My name is Rajib Biswas. And this is my first post in Hugo.

### What was I thinking
For the most part, I have been looking for a smart solution to get rid of all the heave load of the WordPress. For most of my years in development, I have used WordPress to create blog and other sites. But to be honest, I never liked it. The main issue was the speed. It always loads lots of unnecessary scripts and style that I would never need in that page. Yet, they continue to suck up a lot of the bandwidth.
Building a nice looking page in WordPress is not difficult either. But the problem is you may have to maintain lots of lots of plugins for getting the desired look and feel that you have wished for your website. In that case, installing a lots of plugins mean firstly, your site is gonna get slower and slower, and secondly, as soon as any of the plugin gets updated, all of your designs face a threat of disintegrating. So you may have visited your site last night and it was okay, but it the morning, you suddenly will find that it looks horrible. Because some of the plugins got updated.
All of these let me to seek for static site. For some day, I planned to hardcore a static site with php. But maintaining all different components and directories got difficult as soon as I had a lot of posts. Yet, I was loving it as I had all the control over the design and every single scripts that had been generating on different pages. It was super fast. But I had to abandon it finally.
